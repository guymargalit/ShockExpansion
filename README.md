Shock Expansion
===============

This repository contains a MATLAB function that will calculate the coefficient of lift and drag using Shock Expansion theory.

1.  The oblique shock relations computations were adapted from https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/28242-oblique-shock-relations-solver

Usage
-----
Input a Mach number, angle of attack, and a half angle if analyzing a diamond airfoil. For flat plate, set epsilon to 0.
